# BuiltExtension

This is a [3DSlicer](https://www.slicer.org/) extension made for the prosthetic design process. Using it will decrease the time needed to mark bones and nerves in CT scans, allowing patients to get prosthetics faster.

To prepare your machine for testing, do the following:

1. Install the **nightly** build of 3DSlicer for your operating system, found [here](http://download.slicer.org/).
2. Download the "Demo DICOM.zip" file provided by the FastSlice team, found [here](https://drive.google.com/a/umich.edu/file/d/0B0dHApcloVBkVElBMDU0NDk3NGc/view?usp=sharing).
3. Clone the extension's repository: `git clone https://github.com/FastSlice/BuiltExtension.git`.

To test the extension, follow the instructions in [this YouTube video](https://youtu.be/qJFSeH6n0QE).
